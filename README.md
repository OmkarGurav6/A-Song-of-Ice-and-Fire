# Books about the world of asoiaf

# Order in which to read books :

  1. A Game Of Thrones
  2. A Clash Of Kings
  3. A Storm Of Swords
  4. A Feast For Crows
  5. A Dance With Dragons


  You can read “A Feast for Crows” and “A Dance with Dragons“ both simultaneously. 
  
  For those who may be contemplating the idea and challenge of reading both “A Feast for Crows” and “A Dance with Dragons“ at the same time/together – You will most likely need a   guidebook (or more likely a psychiatrist😂) for help.
  
  There is a [list](http://afeastwithdragons.com/) which has the correct full combined “POV Chapters” from both books and the order in which to read them.

  You can read "The World of Ice and Fire and Untold History of Westeros" before or after reading main 5 books but it is recommeneded to read this book after reading all main       books. 
  
  You should read "Fire and Blood Volume 1" after reading all main 5 books because it contains many spoilers about main 5 books.
  
  You can read "The Princess and the Queen" if you want to but all of the story in this book is covered and expanded more in "Fire and Blood Volume 1".
  
  "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms" is the book you can read after main 5 books as it contains the adventures of "Dunk" (the future Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Duncan the   Tall) and "Egg" (the future king Aegon V Targaryen), some 90 years before the events of the main books.
