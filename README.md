# Order in which to read books :

  1. A Game Of Thrones
  2. A Clash Of Kings
  3. A Storm Of Swords
  4. A Feast For Crows
  5. A Dance With Dragons
  
  <br/><br/>

  * You can read _**“A Feast for Crows”**_ and  _**“A Dance with Dragons“**_ both simultaneously.

    For those who may be contemplating the idea and challenge of reading both  _**“A Feast for Crows” _**_ and  _**“A Dance with Dragons“**_ at the same time/together – You will       most likely need a guidebook (or more likely a psychiatrist😂) for help.
    
    There is a [list](http://afeastwithdragons.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} which has the correct full combined _**“POV Chapters”**_ from both books and the order in         which to read them.

  * You can read _**"The World of Ice and Fire Untold History of Westeros"**_ before or after reading main 5 books but it is recommeneded to read this book after reading all main     books. 
  
  * You should read _**"Fire and Blood Volume 1"**_ after reading all main 5 books because it contains many spoilers about main 5 books.
  
  * You can read _**"The Princess and the Queen"**_ if you want to but all of the story in this book is covered and expanded more in _**"Fire and Blood Volume 1"**_.
  
  * _**"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"**_ is the book you can read after main 5 books as it contains the adventures of _**"Dunk"**_ (the future Lord Commander of the Kingsguard,     Ser Duncan the Tall) and _**"Egg"**_ (the future king Aegon V Targaryen), some 90 years before the events of the main books.
